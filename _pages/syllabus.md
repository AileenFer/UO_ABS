## Course Description:
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the core concepts and approaches for the analysis of biological data, particularly large data sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for graduate students. It is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of covering all major topics in univariate data analysis, forming a foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical programming language R.

## Course Information:
Schedule: Tue/Thur 10:00 AM - 11:50 AM, 40 Science Library

## Grading:
* Three graded homework assignments - 66%
* Participation in weekly ungraded exercises and peer review
* The final course letter grade will be determined based on a curve of total performance in the course

## Homework assignments:
Two problem sets will be assigned to be turned in the following week (see course schedule). The intent of each homework is to expose students to running specific analyses in R. You will complete the analyses and submit both your R code and resultant output via the Canvas course website. More details regarding each home work will be given at the appropriate time.
